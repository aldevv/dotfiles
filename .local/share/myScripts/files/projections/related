say you have core/models.py, core/serializers.py, core/urls.py , core/utils.py and core/views.py

the first three are in the projections file like this:

{
    "*/serializers.py": {
        "alternate": ["{}/tests/test_endpoints.py"],
        "type": "seri"
    },
    "*/urls.py": {
        "alternate": ["{}/tests/test_endpoints.py"],
        "type": "urls"
    },
    "*/models.py": {
        "alternate": ["{}/tests/test_endpoints.py"],
        "type": "models"
    }
}

if you enter views.py and do Emodels, is not gonna work because is not related anywhere,
if you enter utils.py and do Emodels, is also not goint to work, because is not related to models.

If we do this:

    "*/models.py": {
        "alternate": ["core/tests/test_endpoints.py"],
        "related": ["{}/views.py", "{}/utils.py"],
        "type": "models"
    }

we will become able to do Emodels from views.py and also from utils.py, since we made them related

if there are no related defined, then the related becomes the alternate, which means you can go to models
from test_endpoints.py doing Emodels

    "*/models.py": {
        "alternate": ["core/tests/test_endpoints.py"],
        "type": "models"
    }
